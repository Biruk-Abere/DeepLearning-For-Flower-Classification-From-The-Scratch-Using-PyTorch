# DeepLearning-For-Flower-Classification-From-The-Scratch-Using-PyTorch

For this project we will pick a dataset of our choice and apply the concepts learned to train deep learning models end to end with PyTorch expermenting different hyper parameters and metrics.

1) Find a dataset online
2) Understand and describe the modeling objective clearly

       * A) What type of data is it ? (Images , Text , Audio )
       * B) What type of problem is it ? (Regression , Classification , Generative Modeling )
3) Clean data if required and perform exploratory analysis (plot graphs , ask questions )

4) Class Analysis (Check The Class Distribuition)
5) Image Transform and Image Augumentation 
6) Separating the data to training and testing 
7) Move To GPU 
8) Modeling

   * A) Define a model (Network Architecture)
   * B) Pick some hyper parameters
   * C) Train the model
   * D) Make predictions on samples
   * E) Plotting The Trends 
   * F) Evaluate on test dataset
   * G) Save the model weights
   * H) Record the metrics
   * I) Try different hyper parameters and regularization
